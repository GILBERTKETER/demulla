# Demulla Employee Check-in & Attendance Management System

## Executive Summary

As **Demulla** continues expanding its loan system and integrating multiple internal tools into one centralized platform, it is crucial to maintain a balance between scalability, reliability, and independence.

While having one unified system may sound efficient, over-integration introduces serious operational risks. If one core module such as the loan system fails, dependent systems like attendance, ticketing, or HR functionalities can also fail. This single point of failure could disrupt the entire organization‚Äôs workflow.

This proposal introduces a **modular Employee Check-in and Attendance Management System for Demulla**. It integrates seamlessly with the existing loan system for authentication but remains technically independent. This ensures that employee attendance, HR reports, and internal communications continue functioning even if the loan system experiences downtime.


## Problem Statement

The HR Manager raised concerns about the difficulty of tracking employee attendance across multiple branches.  
Currently, LOCOs and branch managers take photos as proof of presence and send them to HR ‚Äî a method that is time-consuming, inconsistent, and vulnerable to manipulation.

This manual process makes it hard to:
- Verify attendance consistently.
- Detect late arrivals or early departures.
- Maintain accurate, auditable records for HR and payroll.


## Proposed Solution

The solution is a **dedicated, modular attendance system** designed for Demulla that:
- Uses secure, branch-based QR codes for check-in and check-out.
- Tracks employee **location** during check-in for verification.
- Provides real-time dashboards for branch managers and HR.
- Automates notifications via WhatsApp and email.
- Functions independently from the loan system during downtime.

This ensures reliability, transparency, and scalability without introducing dependency risks.


## Key System Advantages

1. **Independence and Reliability**  
   - Operates even when the loan platform is offline.  
   - Includes a backup sign-in mode with cached credentials or offline QR verification.

2. **Secure Integration**  
   - Uses Demulla‚Äôs existing loan system authentication.  
   - Supports role-based permissions (Employee, Manager, HR/Admin).  
   - Optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for sensitive roles.

3. **Modular Architecture**  
   - Core features (attendance, announcements, etc.) function independently.  
   - Easy to expand without disrupting other systems.


## Roles and Permissions

### Employees

   - Provides branch-level and company-wide trends.

4. **Automated Notifications**  
   - Sends alerts via WhatsApp and email for lateness, absence, or flagged check-ins.  

5. **Manual Check-in (with Justification)**  
   - For employees without smartphones or during technical issues.  
   - All entries logged for audit and transparency.

6. **Payroll Integration**  
   - Exports attendance data to CSV/Excel.  
   - Tracks overtime, absences, and fieldwork.  

7. **Gamification**  
   - Introduces leaderboards and punctuality rewards.

   - Combine attendance, punctuality, and fieldwork data for KPI-based performance reviews.  

5. **Task Management System**  
   - Employees can log and update their daily tasks.  
   - Managers can assign, monitor, and review employee tasks in real-time.  
   - Tasks can be categorized by **priority**, **urgency**, or **type**.  
   - Automated **notifications** remind employees before task deadlines.  
   - Enables daily productivity tracking and historical task analytics for performance insights.

6. **Digital Suggestion Box**
